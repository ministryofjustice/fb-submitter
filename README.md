##Â Submission Payload Schema

`schemas/submission_payload.json` is the schema for the decrypted submission. The request object should take the form:

```
{
  encrypted_submission: 'WTq8zYcZfaWVvMncigHqwQ=='
}
```

Once decrypted the submission is validated against the schema before being re-encrypted and saved in the DB.
